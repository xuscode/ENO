# 重置数据库密码

### 查询默认的密码保存时间

```sql
SELECT * FROM dba_profiles WHERE profile='DEFAULT' AND resource_name='PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME';
```

### 修改为不限期，若有定期更换密码的需求，则可以设置为每个密码更换周期所需的天数（如：30:，表示每过30天就需要重置一次密码）

=== "不限期"
    ```sql
    ALTER PROFILE DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME UNLIMITED;
    ```

=== "30天的密码有效期"
    ```sql
    ALTER PROFILE DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 30;
    ```

### 确定密码过期的用户，如果不确定，可以通过查询所有用户，并结合用户的创建时间和当前时间的时间差，推测出密码过期的用户

```sql
select * from all_users;
```

### 查看用户状态

```sql
select username,account_status from dba_users;
```

### 数据库链接方法

```sql
sqlplus /nolog
conn /as sysdba;
ALTER PROFILE DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME UNLIMITED;
alter user x3dpassadmin identified by x3dpassadmin;
alter user x3dpasstokens identified by x3dpasstokens;
alter user x3ddashadmin identified by x3ddashadmin;
alter user X3DSPACE IDENTIFIED BY X3DSPACE;
```

```sql
alter user x3dpassadmin identified by x3dpassadmin;
alter user x3dpassadmin account unlock;

alter user x3dpasstokens identified by x3dpasstokens;
alter user x3dpasstokens account unlock;

alter user x3ddashadmin identified by x3ddashadmin;
alter user x3ddashadmin account unlock;

alter user spaceuser identified by spaceuser;
alter user spaceuser account unlock;
```

### 不过期

```sql
alter user spaceuser IDENTIFIED BY spaceuser;
```

### 链接数据库，检查人员状态

```sql
sqlplus / as sysdba
select username,account_status from dba_users;
```

### 链接数据库

```sql
conn /as sysdba
```

已连接。

### 解锁人员

```sql
alter user system account unlock;
```

### 退出数据库

```sql
exit
```
